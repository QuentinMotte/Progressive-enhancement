                <h2>The story</h2>
                <p>
                    Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran
                    away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to
                    commiserate. They said, <q class="villagers"> We are so sorry to hear your horse
                    has run away. This is most unfortunate.</q> The farmer said,
                    <strong> <q class="farmer">Maybe.</q></strong> The next day the horse came back
                    bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening
                    everybody came back and said, <q class="villagers"> Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a
                    great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</q> The farmer
                    again said, <strong> <q class="farmer">Maybe.</q></strong> The following day his
                    son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it,
                    he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said, <q class="villagers">
                    Oh dear, that’s too <span class="red">bad</span> ,</q> and the farmer responded,
                    <strong> <q class="farmer">Maybe.</q></strong> The next day the conscription
                    officers came around to conscript people into the army, and
                    they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all
                    the neighbors came around and said, <q class="villagers">Isn’t that great!</q> 
                    Again, he said, <strong> <q class="farmer">Maybe.</q></strong> The whole process
                    of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity,
                    and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that
                    happens in it is <span class="green">good</span>  or <span class="red">bad</span>  — <blockquote cite="https://wellsbaum.blog/2018/01/27/alan-watts-the-story-of-the-chinese-farmer/">because you never know what
                    will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never
                    know what will be the consequences of <span class="green">good</span>  fortune <br />

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                    <span class="green">Good</span>  and <span class="red"> Bad</span> are just one perspective. Bananas are <span class="green">good</span>  for
                    monkeys, but monkeys are not <span class="green">good</span> for bananas. Let's not
                    make a big deal out of it...
